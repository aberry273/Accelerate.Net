    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <details open>
        <summary><strong>Why 'parot'?</strong></summary>
        <p>
            We loved where Twitter was going. But feel it is a legacy site.
        </p>
    </details>

        <summary><strong>How will you manage real time data?</strong></summary>
        <p>
            Content can be filtered to limit what you see at one time and sorted based on what is important. Otherwise viewed in real-time like any chat is.
        </p>

        <summary><strong>Is there only a single feed?</strong></summary>
        <p>
            We have a single feed, or curate their own posts in their own channels. Channels can aggregate other posts with the same tag or category.
        </p>

        <summary><strong>Why not Threads/BlueSky?</strong></summary>
        <p>
            We see this as clones of Twitter. We want to make something a bit different and focusing on building for real-time discussions and events.
        </p>

        <summary><strong>What about AI</strong></summary>
        <p>
            We want human based discussions. Not content generated by bots. We will work hard to ensure content is effectively tagged and obvious when not from a human.
